we have to valide the form data before we send it to the server. when we think about validation we have to do two very important thing
the first one is the 
1 validation this is like chaking weather the data in the feilds are fullfilled the requirements 
2 sanitixation this is like cleaning the data or romeving the data those lead issue in the code 

to do this we have to use the poackage called the express-valildator and rewuire it in the code 
this package help as in to two thing

the the express-validator works 

first we have to do validation to do this we have to destrucre the body funcition and call it with the name of the feild asa
an argument and chain every validation we want 

what this did is it validate based on the spoecified validation and if there is any error is return that error the the req object
